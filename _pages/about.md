## Bio

I am a Machine Learning Research Engineer at PayPal Singapore with 2+ years of research and application experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), and Graph Neural Networks. I enjoy solving problems and building products that make differences.

I obtained my undergraduate degree in the National University of Singapore, majoring in Computer Engineer. I was really interested in Machine Learning and was active member in [The Web Information Retrieval / Natural Language Processing Group (WING)](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/). My final year thesis improves Fake News Detection System with Social Context Information using Graph Neural Network and was [published](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3517214) in ACM CIKM 2022 as the Best Long Research Paper.

I also enjoy writing blogposts what I learn and share it with the community. Recently my friend and I founded the Vietnamese Data Science & Artificial Intelligence Community ([VNDA](https://vnda-community.github.io/)) where Vietnamese professionals and students in Singapore who are interested in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence can share their knowledge, experience, and opportunities in this growing fields.

I often play football on the weekend and the piano in my free time. My favourite piece is Minuet in G Major by Bach.
